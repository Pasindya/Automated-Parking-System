                <h1>How secure is an automated parking system?<br> <br> </h1><br>
                <p class="par">Automated parking systems are much more secure than traditional record keeping and payment collection systems. 
                    Because all information is stored securely in the cloud and encrypted at the head of the transaction, 
                    here is minimal risk of privileged customer information being breached.
                    <br><br>
                    In cash or manual credit card transactions, parking asset owners assume much more risk. In an automated parking system,
                     99.9% of security protocol is managed by the technology provider, the main task that falls in the responsibility of the asset owner or
                      operator is routinely checking credit card readers for skimmers.
                    When shopping for an automated parking system, PCI compliance is a key consideration in determining safety and security.
